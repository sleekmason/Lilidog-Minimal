### TO CHANGE MENU ITEMS
Open prepends.csv file to add items to the TOP of the menu.  
The format example is: Display-name, program-name, icon-name
See the lxterminal entry for an example.
Open ~/.config/jgmenu/append.csv to add items to the END of the menu,
and for further examples.


###TO CHANGE THEMES EASILY
Use the command: 'jgmenu-interactive' in a terminal for the 
jgmenu interactive menu. (various choices to be made).
Use  "o" or "g" to change to the openbox theme or the gtk theme 
colors after changing gtk themes.
Changing other items here could have a detrimental affect on your menu.
However, why not have a little fun and learn something;)
There are backups to all the original files in ~/.config/jgmenu.bak 
if a mistake is made.


### TO CHANGE ICONS
Open ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc -> icon_theme (line 54)


###*NOTE
If you would like to edit a full menu already in place, 
uncomment line 5 of ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc, and then rename
prepend.csv and append.csv to "prepend.csv.bak" and "append.csv.bak"
You will still need to edit, but may find this menu more complete;)

"jgmenu-interactive" uses urxvt to open the complete line of:
'jgmenu_run init --interactive -i' in case you do away with urxvt.
If you have better ideas, tell me.
'man jgmenu' in a terminal for more info!
