### TO CHANGE MENU ITEMS
Open prepends.csv file to add items to the TOP of the menu.  
The format example is: Display-name, program-name, icon-name
See the lxterminal entry for an example.
Open ~/.config/jgmenu/append.csv to add items to the END of the menu,
and for further examples.


###TO CHANGE THEMES EASILY
Go to 'jgmenu Theme Changer' in the Configuration menu to open  
the jgmenu interactive menu. (various choices to be made).
Use  "o" or "g" to change to the openbox theme or the gtk theme 
colors after changing gtk themes.


### TO CHANGE ICONS
Open ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc -> icon_theme (line 54)


###*NOTE
If you would like to edit a full menu already in place, 
uncomment line 5 of ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc, and then rename
prepend.csv and append.csv to "prepend.csv.bak" and "append.csv.bak"
You will still need to edit, but may find this menu more complete;)

'man jgmenu' in a terminal for more info!
