##
Use the prepends.csv file to add items to the TOP of the menu.  
The format example is: Display-name, program-name, icon-name
See the lxterminal entry for an example.
Use ~/.config/jgmenu/append.csv to add items to the END of the menu,
and for further examples.

*NOTE
If you would like to edit a full menu already in place, 
uncomment line 5 of ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc.
You will still need to edit, but may find this menu a bit more complete;)
